## EC2

An EC2 instance is a virtual server in the AWS Cloud. When you launch an EC2 instance, the instance type that you specify determines the hardware available to your instance. 

## Features of Amazon EC2

Amazon EC2 provides the following high-level features:

1. Instances
Virtual servers.

2. Amazon Machine Images (AMIs)
Preconfigured templates for your instances that package the components you need for your server (including the operating system and additional software).

3. Instance types
Various configurations of CPU, memory, storage, networking capacity, and graphics hardware for your instances.

4. Amazon EBS volumes
Persistent storage volumes for your data using Amazon Elastic Block Store (Amazon EBS).

5. Instance store volumes
Storage volumes for temporary data that is deleted when you stop, hibernate, or terminate your instance.

6. Key pairs
Secure login information for your instances. AWS stores the public key and you store the private key in a secure place.

7. Security groups
A virtual firewall that allows you to specify the protocols, ports, and source IP ranges that can reach your instances, and the destination IP ranges to which your instances can connect.
