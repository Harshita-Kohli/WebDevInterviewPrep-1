S3 - Simple Storage Service
- Infinitely scaling storage
- Used for backup and storage
- Archival of files in S3 for accessing later
- Static application hosting
- S3 stores files(objects) in Buckets(directories)
  - Buckets are defined at region level. So, although S3 looks like a global service, but buckets are created at region-level.

- S3 objects have keys and values:
  - Key specifies the entire path of the file: prefix+object name
  - Value specifies the content of the object

- S3 pre-signed URL: A url that contains the signature(the credentials enocded in the url). When accessing the S3 object via Pre-signed URL, I get access to the contents because I am authorised to access it since it has my credentials.
   -  But via public URL, I am unable to access and it gives unauthorised.

- S3 Bucket Policy: 
- The most common way to implement Security in S3
- Policies attached directly onto S3 bucket.
- In exam, wherever we see CROSS ACCOUNT ACCESS --> S3 BUCKET POLICY.
- Allow **Cross Account Access** to the S3 bucket ie. a  user from another account can access the S3 bucket created in your account.
