/*AngularJS (1.x) approaches building an application by extending HTML markup and injecting various constructs (e.g. Directives, Controllers, Services) at runtime.
    As a result, AngularJS is very opinionated about the greater architecture of your application — these abstractions are certainly useful in 
some cases, but in many situations, they come at the cost of flexibility.


By contrast, React focuses exclusively on the creation of components, and has few (if any) opinions about an application’s architecture. 
This allows a developer an incredible amount of flexibility in choosing the architecture they deem “best” —
though it also places the responsibility of choosing (or building) those parts on the developer.


React enables developers to render a user interface. To create a full front-end application, developers need other pieces, 
such as state management tools like Redux.

Like React, Angular enables developers to render a user interface, but it is a “batteries included” framework that includes prescriptive,
opinionated solutions to common requirements like state management.

While there are many other considerations when comparing React and Angular specifically, this key architectural difference means that:

Using a library such as React can give a project a greater ability to evolve parts of the system—again for example, state management—over time,
when new solutions are created by the open source community.
Using a framework such as Angular can make it easier for developers to get started and can also simplify maintenance.*/
