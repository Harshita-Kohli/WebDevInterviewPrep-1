What is the diff between display:inline,display:block and display:inline-block?
ans-display:block, block elements take the entire width available for them,effectively they add a line break b4 and after them.
display:inline, take minimum amount of space possible.But we cant set width and height for them
display:inline-block ,act like inline(i.e take min space possible),but we can give our height n width
