* ID’s are unique
Each element can have only one ID
Each page can have only one element with that ID
you should only use ID’s once, but you can use classes over and over.

*****************************ID’s have special browser functionality*********************************
Classes have no special abilities in the browser, but ID’s do have one very important trick up their sleeve.
This is the “hash value” in the URL. If you have a URL like http://yourdomain.com#comments, the browser will attempt 
to locate the element with an ID of “comments” and will automatically scroll the page to show that element.
It is important to note here that the browser will scroll whatever element it needs to in order to show that element,
so if you did something special like a scrollable DIV area within your regular body, that div will be scrolled too.

This is an important reason right here why having ID’s be absolutely unique is important. So your browser knows where to scroll!


* Classes are not unique
You can use the same class on multiple elements.
You can use multiple classes on the same element.
Any styling information that needs to be applied to multiple objects on a page should be done with a class.

* Elements can have BOTH
There is nothing stopping you from having both an ID and a Class on a single element. In fact, it is often a very good idea.
Take for example the default markup for a WordPress comment list item:

<li id="comment-27299" class="item">

*CSS doesn’t care
Regarding CSS, there is nothing you can do with an ID that you can’t do with a Class and vise versa.

*JavaScript cares
JavaScript depends on there being only one page element with any particular id, or else the commonly used
getElementById function wouldn’t be dependable.
