Why would you chose “let” over “var”?
While programming in Javascript it is a good practice not to define variables as global variables. 
This is because it is possible to inadvertently modify the global variable from anywhere within the Javascript code.
To prevent this one needs to ensure that the scope of the variables are limited to the code block within which they need to be executed.
In the past before keyword let was introduced as part of ES6, to circumvent the issue of variable scoping using var, programmers used the
IIFE pattern to prevent the pollution of the global name space. However since the introduction of let, the IIFE pattern is no longer required,
and the scope of the variable defined using let is limited to the code block within which it is defined.
