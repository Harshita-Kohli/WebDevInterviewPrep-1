What will be the output of the following code snippet?
const human={
  age:10,
 grow:()=>{
   this.age++;
 } 
}
human.grow();
console.log(human.age);
a.NaN b.11 c.12 d.None of these
ans- d.None of these as the above program outputs 10
Explanation:when we call human.grow(), the this.age++ executed
inside an arrow function,which takes this of its surrounding and not 
of the calling object.Here this in arrow function-window object.
So this.age++ didnt result in increment of age value.
