/*What is the StrictMode component and why would you use it?
<StrictMode /> is a component included with React to provide additional visibility of potential issues in components. 
If the application is running in development mode, any issues are logged to the development console, but these warnings are not shown if the application 
is running in production mode.

Developers use <StrictMode /> to find problems such as deprecated lifecycle methods and legacy patterns, to ensure that all React components follow current best practices.

<StrictMode /> can be applied at any level of an application component hierarchy, which allows it to be adopted incrementally within a codebase.*/
