## Soap vs Rest:
[Refer from AWS](https://aws.amazon.com/compare/the-difference-between-soap-rest/)

- In Spring Boot, REST and SOAP represent distinct approaches to building web services.
REST:
- REST is an architectural style that leverages HTTP methods and conventions, typically using JSON for data exchange, making it easier to implement and more lightweight compared to SOAP.
- RESTful services in Spring Boot are commonly created using the **@RestController annotation**, where controllers return data directly, often in JSON format, without requiring a separate view layer.
SOAP:
- SOAP, on the other hand, is a **protocol** that defines a strict message format based on XML, requiring a WSDL (Web Services Description Language) file to describe the service interface.
- In Spring Boot, SOAP services are typically built using Spring Web Services: **@WebService annotation**, which handles the sending and receiving of SOAP messages.
- SOAP is often used in enterprise environments where enhanced security, transaction support, and strict contract enforcement are required, such as in legacy banking systems.

## Principles of REST:

REST is a software architectural style that imposes six conditions on how an API should work. These are the six principles REST APIs follow:

- Client-server architecture. The sender and receiver are independent of each other regarding technology, platforming, programming language, and so on.
- Layered. The server can have several intermediaries that work together to complete client requests, but they are invisible to the client.
- Uniform interface. The API returns data in a standard format that is complete and fully useable.
- Stateless. The API completes every new request independently of previous requests.
- Cacheable. All API responses are cacheable.
- Code on demand. The API response can include a code snippet if required.
 
## Important Annotations in SpringBoot for Implementing Rest:
- [Refer GFG](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/springboot/spring-boot-annotations/)

1. @Controller Annotation
This annotation provides Spring MVC features.
It is used to create Controller classes and simultaneously it handles the HTTP requests.
Generally we use @Controller annotation with @RequestMapping annotation to map HTTP requests with methods inside a controller class.

2.  @RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
3.  @RequestMapping Annotation
  - Maps HTTP requests to handler methods.
    ``@RestController
public class Geeks{
    @RequestMapping(value = "/welcome", method = RequestMethod.GET)
    public String welcome() {
        return "Welcome to Spring Boot!";
    }
4. @RequestBody Annotation: convert HTTP requests from request body from incoming JSON format to domain objects.
5.  @ResponseBody Annotation: This annotation is used to convert the domain object into HTTP response in the form of JSON or any other text.

## Advantages of SpringBoot:
- **Spring Boot is described as "opinionated"** because it makes automated decisions about the configuration and setup of an application based on the dependencies present in the project's classpath.
 This approach, known as "convention over configuration," reduces the need for manual setup by providing sensible default configurations that align with best practices.

## Disadvantages of Using Spring Boot:
- The main struggle for many developers when using Spring Boot is the lack of control over the system. The **opinionated style installs many extra dependencies** it assumes the system will need. 
By installing all these extra dependencies (which sometimes go unused), the deployment binary size can become very large in Spring Boot Applications
- Since the framework has been built to be agile and lightweight mainly focussing on APIs and micro services to be built using the framework, therefore **it should not be used for monolithic applications.**


What is a bean in Java?
A Java Bean is basically a simple Java class that:
- Has private fields (variables) â†’ Data is kept safe.
- Provides public getters and setters â†’ Other classes can access/modify the data in a controlled way.
- Has a no-argument (i.e. default constructor) constructor â†’ Can be easily created by frameworks/tools.
- Implements Serializable (optional) â†’ So it can be saved/transferred if needed.
ðŸ‘‰ Think of it like a capsule: it holds data inside, and you use methods (getters/setters) to open it carefully.


ðŸŒ¿ What is a Bean in Spring (Spring Boot)?
- In Spring/Spring Boot, the word Bean has a special meaning.
- It doesnâ€™t just mean the Java Bean class â€” it means any Java object that is managed by the Spring IoC container.
- The IoC container (Inversion of Control) is like a factory in Spring that creates and manages objects (beans) for you.
- You donâ€™t create objects using new everywhere. Instead, you let Spring create and provide them whenever needed. This is how Dependency Injection (DI) works in Spring.
