Explanation:
Making a phone number clickable is easily done with HTML. HTML5 includes protocols such as tel: and mailto: that browsers can use. 
Browsers respond differently to these protocols. Some will launch the phone app and add the number to the display while waiting for 
you to click the Call button. Others will make the call, while others will ask if it’s okay first.

Since it’s HTML, you can add the protocols anywhere on your site including the header, footer, sidebars, 
within the content of posts and pages, and within widgets.

Adding an HTML Phone Number Call Link to your Website:

Add the code as text to the location you want the link to appear:
<a href="tel:123-456-7890">123-456-7890</a>

href=tel: creates the call link. This tells the browser how to use the number.

"tel: 123-456-7890" creates the HTML phone number. The number within the quotes is the number it will call.
The number within the >< tags is the visual portion and it can be anything you want it to be including the phone number,
a line of text such as “Click to Call” or “Call Now”, or any other call to action you want.
It should be descriptive of what’s going to happen when they click.

Displaying a message instead of the number would look like this:
<a href="tel:123-456-7890">CLICK TO CALL</a>
********************
Adding an Extension
Some phone numbers have an extension. You can add code that will create a brief pause before
dialing the extension number. Adding P in front of the extension will add a one-second pause. The code might look like this:

<a href="tel:123-456-7890p123">CLICK TO CALL</a>
This dials the number, waits one second, and then dials extension.

You can have it to wait for a dial tone by using w instead of p.

Adding Country Codes
Country codes can be added by including a + along with your country’s code before
the phone number. An example might look like this:

<a href="tel:+1123-456-7890">123-456-7890</a>
