What is getElementById()?
Syntax:

element = document.getElementById(id);

Returns a reference to the element by its ID. If the element with the specified ID is not in the document, it will returns null.
This method comes with a sister function called querySelectorAll() which selects all the elements
that match a particular selector from the DOM.

What is querySelector()?
Syntax:
element = document.querySelector(selectors);

Returns the first element within the document that matches the specified group of selectors, or null if no matches are found.

getElementById vs querySelector:SIMILARITY
The obvious similarity between these two methods is that they both select elements from a web page. 
They do so in different ways.

With a querySelector statement, you can select an element based on a CSS selector. This means you can 
select elements by ID, class, or any other type of selector. 
Using the getElementById method, you can only select an element by its ID.

Generally, you should opt for the selector that most clearly gets the job done.

If you only need to select an element by ID or class, you can use getElementById or getElementsByClassName, respectively.
If you need to use a more elaborate rule to select elements, the querySelector method is your best option.
To help you understand better, please look at the following example:

<ul>
 <li id="web-id">PHP</li>
 <li>HTML</li>
 <li class="web-class">CSS</li>
 <li class="web-class">JavaScript</li>
</ul>
To get the HTML content of the first li, whose id is web-id, with getElementById:

document.getElementById('web-id');

Now with querySelector:
document.querySelector('#web-id');

getElementById vs querySelector: DIFFERENCE
What if you want to get the HTML content of the third li? You will not be able to use getElementById because 
there is no id associated with it. But you can so with querySelector.

document.querySelector('ul li.web-class').innerHTML;
Or just simply
document.querySelector('li.web-class').innerHTML;

getElementById vs querySelector: Performance
getElementById is faster and better supported than querySelector.

Both of these functions are powerful but you must decide which one better suits your need.If you have a complicated page
and you do not want to add id over all it, then use querySelector.
